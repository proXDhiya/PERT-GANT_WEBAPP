### What is PERT?
Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a project management tool used to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project. It is a way to visualize the tasks involved in completing a project, identify task dependencies, estimate task durations, and calculate the overall project duration.

In this project, we will create a web application that will help us to manage our projects. We will be able to create a user account, create a project, add tasks to the project, and assign a task to a user. We will also be able to see the progress of the project and the tasks.
